// Idea #1
// Create an empty nested array with pre defined lengths
// We know that the start must start with 1 so check if we are at the start of the array and default it to 1
// I wanted to loop over the arrays and check the values located at the same index and the index minus 1 in the previous array this will give us the two values above our current
// if any of the checks are undefined we want to return 1
